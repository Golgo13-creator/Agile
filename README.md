# Agile

Here's a link to the Trello Board where much of the planning and Agile activity was executed: https://trello.com/b/Bo0ohVml/movie-rater.

The Agile project Movie Rater was worked on by a three person developer team. The work was initiated by talking over the project via zoom. 
We then transitioned to the trello board linked above. We started our board from left to right starting with user stories. Once we 
reached a satisfactory amount of user stories, we created accompanying acceptance criteria and developed tickets labeled as Features 1.0.
We then divided the work into sections. This broke down to one table per person. The goal was for each developer to build out their respective table to include data, models, services, and controllers. Once the developer team achieved the MVP, they would continue to extend the project using the tickets listed under 2.0 Stretch Goals.
